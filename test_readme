PR Size:

Measures the number of lines of code added, modified, or deleted in a Pull Request (PR). Smaller PRs are generally easier to review and are less likely to introduce errors. Smaller code reviews tend to be faster and more effective.
PR Request Cycle Time:

This measures the time from when a PR is opened to when it is closed or merged. A shorter cycle suggests a more efficient workflow, while a longer cycle can indicate bottlenecks or delays in the development process.
PR Code Review Lead Time:

Measures the time from when a review is requested for a PR until the reviewer starts reviewing the code. A long lead time can indicate that reviewers are overloaded or that there aren't enough resources allocated for reviews.
PR Success Rate:

Represents the percentage of PRs that are successfully merged into the main branch without needing multiple review cycles or significant changes. A low percentage could indicate issues with code quality or misalignment with standards.
PR Comments Count:

This is the number of comments made on a PR. A high number of comments may indicate complex discussions or areas that need more clarification. While some comments are constructive, too many could reflect quality issues or misalignment.
Negative Feedback Rate:

Measures the amount of negative feedback received on PRs. This feedback could include requested changes, critical comments about code quality, or the need to rewrite significant sections. A high rate might reflect misunderstandings of requirements or issues with code quality.
PR Rework Time:

Measures how long it takes to make the requested changes after the first review of the PR. Long rework time can suggest a lack of clarity in initial requirements or poor code quality in the initial submission.
PR Review Time:

This is the time a reviewer takes from when they start reviewing a PR to when they complete the review. A prolonged review time could indicate complexity in the code or lack of reviewer availability.
